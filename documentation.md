## Learning Objectives Draft

|-|-|
|Topic|Solar System|
|Topic Overview||
|Ideas for visual styles, colors or interactive components:|2D Animation/simulation of the Solar System in HTML/CSS/JS using WebGL ([goocreate.com](http://goocreate.com))|
|Target Audience:|5 - 7|
|User Skills (assumed)|Ability to differentiate between shapes, size and color. Able to read. Know that the earth is round. Ability to use a tablet (android/iOS) or web browser|
|Skills they may not have|Ability to judge small distances (relatively speaking, earth distances)|
|Delivery Mode|Website|
|Software Requirements|A modern web browser with Javascript and WebGl capabilities|
|Technical Constraints|A GPU capable of displaying WebGL content. Must be viewable on a tablet(touch devices)|
|Previous Attempts|n/a|
|Lessons Learnt from Others Attempts|n/a|
|Learning Object overall Goals:|Learn the Solar System|
|Learning specific Objectives:|The student will be able to Identify the Sun from a picture or animation of the solar system without error.<br>Without error, the student will be able to identify Stars and become aware that our Sun is a star given a diagram or animation.<br>The student will be able to Identify Earth from a picture or animation of the solar system without error.<br>The student will be able to name some of the planets from our solar system from a picture or animation.<br>The student will be partially able to draw and describe the the solar system. With a minimum  being the Sun, Earth and our Moon.<br>The student will be able to Identify our Moon from a picture or animation of the solar system without error.<br>The student will be able to Identify other Planet’s Moons from a picture or animation of the planet and moons without error.<br>The student will be able to Identify our Solar System from a picture or animation of a number of systems, without error<br>The student will be able to identify Comets and Asteroids and differentiate between the two without error.<br>The student will be able to differentiate between different planets types (terrestrial and Jovian) by looking at the size, location, composition and presents of rings and moons from a picture or animation without error.|
|Topic Concepts your Learning object will teach:|Where we are in relation to the sun and the Moon. Try to answer the question “What is up in the sky?”|
|Learning Theories informing your design:|Cognitive|
|Will you use some Interface Metaphors?|Yes, maybe plus and minus buttons for zoom, icons for Celestial Objects and a speaker for sound|
|Will you use Scaffolding (what kind)?|Yes, illustrations|
|Testing Users Knowledge|Drag & Drop Quizzes|
