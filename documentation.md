## Learning Objectives Draft

| Topic                                                      | Solar System |
| Topic Overview                                             |  |
| Ideas for visual styles, colors or interactive components  | 2D Animation/simulation of the Solar System in HTML/CSS/JS using WebGL ([goocreate.com](http://goocreate.com)) |
| Target Audience:                                           | 5 - 7|
| User Skills (assumed)                                      | Ability to differentiate between shapes, size and color. Able to read. Know that the earth is round. Ability to use a tablet (android/iOS) or web browser |
| Skills they may not have                                   | Ability to judge small distances (relatively speaking, earth distances) |
| Delivery Mode                                              | Website |
| Software Requirements                                      | A modern web browser with Javascript and WebGl capabilities |
| Technical Constraints                                      | A GPU capable of displaying WebGL content. Must be viewable on a tablet(touch devices) |
| Previous Attempts                                          | n/a |
| Lessons Learnt from Others Attempts                        | n/a |
| Learning Object overall Goals                              | Learn the Solar System |
| Learning specific Objectives                               | The student will be able to Identify the Sun from a picture or animation of the solar system without error.<br>Without error, the student will be able to identify Stars and become aware that our Sun is a star given a diagram or animation.<br>The student will be able to Identify Earth from a picture or animation of the solar system without error.<br>The student will be able to name some of the planets from our solar system from a picture or animation.<br>The student will be partially able to draw and describe the the solar system. With a minimum  being the Sun, Earth and our Moon.<br>The student will be able to Identify our Moon from a picture or animation of the solar system without error.<br>The student will be able to Identify other Planet’s Moons from a picture or animation of the planet and moons without error.<br>The student will be able to Identify our Solar System from a picture or animation of a number of systems, without error<br>The student will be able to identify Comets and Asteroids and differentiate between the two without error.<br>The student will be able to differentiate between different planets types (terrestrial and Jovian) by looking at the size, location, composition and presents of rings and moons from a picture or animation without error. |
| Topic Concepts your Learning object will teach             | Where we are in relation to the sun and the Moon. Try to answer the question “What is up in the sky?” |
| Learning Theories informing your design                    | Cognitive |
| Will you use some Interface Metaphors?                     | Yes, maybe plus and minus buttons for zoom, icons for Celestial Objects and a speaker for sound |
| Will you use Scaffolding (what kind)?                      | Yes, illustrations |
| Testing Users Knowledge                                    | Drag & Drop Quizzes |

Comments: I aim to primarily present the content in a visual style. And In a Hierarchical learning style.


## Learning Objectives

|Topic          | Solar System |
|Time           | 2 hours |
|Audience       | Australian primary school students aged between 5-7, Male and Female, basic primary school Knowledge required, can be completed at home or school, A tablet or computer with a modern browser and internet is required, a quiet room or class room environment is recommended. Users should have prior knowledge in how to navigate websites, basic literacy, maths and creative thinking. |
|Goals          | *Primary Goal:* To get the Student to pass in primary school science topic about the Solar System.<br>*Secondary Goal:* Try to answer the common questions like Where we are in relation to the Sun and the Moon? and What is up in the sky? |
|Objectives (3) | The student will be able to Identify different celestial objects (Solar System, planets, moons, stars, comets, asteroids and Kuiper Belt Objects.) from a picture or animation of the solar system without error.<br>The student will be able to Classify different planets types (Terrestrial and Jovian) by looking at the size, location, composition and presents of rings and moons from a picture or animation without error.<br>Students will be able to construct a Model of the solar system with the given website without error. |

| Learning Style  | Visual and Text by using description, illustrations and simulations. Auditorial stimulus is for Auditorial learners that rather like to listen than to read.|
| Learning Theory | Cognitivism in a Linear Way, The information is presented on Tablets and the information can easily be structured to allow linear learning.|

Leaning Style | Context
------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------
Visual        | Solar System Animation
Visual        | Image of Planets, Moons, Stars, Kuiper Belt Comets and Asteroids
Textual       | Description and facts for the different Celestial objects
Auditorial    | Voice over of the description and facts


| Content                        | Solar System, Planets and Moons, Comets & Asteroids, Stars, Kuiper Belt |
| Content Design                 |[![Concept Flowchart](img/flowchart.png)](img/flowchart.png) |
| Design of the Learning Process | There learner will have the ability to explore the solar system using a simulation. Once finished exploring the student can read and look at images about the solar system, planets, moons, sun, comments and asteroids, in that order. After reading about celestial objects a small drag & drop quiz is available. After the quiz the student can re model the solar system using drag & drop. Finally at the end there is an exam that the user must complete. |

I am using the 'Whole to part' sequence method to structure the learning path.
